# 2. Project Summary
This project is the start of a journey to bring the Synergistic Leadership Theory, the first leadership theory of the 21st Century, into a practical, interactive web application. The mission is to develop a platform that not only educates on the theory but also allows users to access leadership effectiveness through **The Organization and Leadership Effectiveness Inventory (OLEI)**.

Stakeholders include Drs. Beverly Irby and Matthew Etchells, alongside a team of students committed to transcending traditional, male-dominant leadership paradigms. The platform will feature an animated, interactive tetrahedral model representing the theory's core factors: Leadership Behaviors, Organizational Structure, External Forces, Attitudes, Values, and Beliefs. This tool will facilitate a deeper understanding of leadership dynamics but also generate personalized leadership style analysis.

# 3. User Stories
- Feature 1: Development Environment Setup
	- [As a] development team,
	- [So that] we can start developing the leadership style analysis tool efficiently,
	- [I want to] set up our development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies.

- Feature 2: Leadership Theory Study
	- [As a] development team,
	- [So that] we can accurately implement its principles into our tool,
	- [I want to] study Synergistic Leadership Theory in-depth (or in a nutshell?).

- Feature 3: Initial UI/UX Design
	- [As a] UI/UX designer,
	- [So that] we have a clear visual direction for our project,
	- [I want to] create initial wireframes for the web application.

- Feature 4: Data Model Design
	- [As a] backend developer,
	- [So that] we can efficiently store and process user inputs,
	- [I want to] design the data model for storing leadership survey responses.

- Feature 5: Interactive Model Interaction
	- [As a] user,
	- [So that] I can select different sides of the tetrahedron and learn about each factor of the leadership theory,
	- [I want to] interact with the tetrahedral model on the website.

- Feature 6: Data Submission
	- [As a] school leader,
	- [So that] I can receive an analysis of my leadership style based on the Synergistic Leadership Theory,
	- [I want to] input my leadership style data through a survey on the website.

- Feature 7: Analysis Result Presentation
	- [As a] school leader,
	- [So that] I can understand my alignment or misalignment within the four factors of the theory,
	- [I want to] see my leadership style analysis presented visually.

- Feature 8: Theory Exploration
	- [As a] visitor to the website,
	- [So that] I can learn about its principles and how it applies to educational leadership,
	- [I want to] explore information about the Synergistic Leadership Theory.

- Feature 9: Access Configuration
	- [As a] project administrator,
	- [So that] users can have tailored experiences based on their user type,
	- [I want to] set different levels of access and views for the data.

# 5. Sprint Backlog

## Objective
To set up the environment and prepare necessary tools for developing a leadership style analysis tool based on the Synergistic Leadership Theory.

## Selected User Stories (for this sprint)
- Feature 1: Development Environment Setup
	- [As a] development team,
	- [So that] we can start developing the leadership style analysis tool efficiently,
	- [I want to] set up our development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies.
	- **Point Value**: 3
	- **Assigned to**: Entire team
	- **Reasoning**: Straightforward task of getting tools and environments aligned. Simple but requires attention to detail to ensure everyone's setup matches.

- Feature 2: Leadership Theory Study
	- [As a] development team,
	- [So that] we can accurately implement its principles into our tool,
	- [I want to] study Synergistic Leadership Theory in-depth.
	- **Point Value**: 5
	- **Assigned to**: Entire team
	- **Reasoning**: It's intellectually demanding and sets the foundation for our project, hence the higher points.

- Feature 3: Initial UI/UX Design
	- [As a] UI/UX designer,
	- [So that] we have a clear visual direction for our project,
	- [I want to] create initial wireframes for the web application.
	- **Point Value**: 4
	- **Assigned to**: Entire team
	- **Reasoning**: A point value of 4 has been allocated because it shapes our project's visual and interactive direction.

- Feature 4: Data Model Design
	- [As a] backend developer,
	- [So that] we can efficiently store and process user inputs,
	- [I want to] design the data model for storing leadership survey responses.
	- **Point Value**: 5
	- **Assigned to**: Entire team
	- **Reasoning**: This involves complex problem-solving skills about the data structures, and requires a prior knowledge of MVC framework as well.

> Sprint Goal: The goal of this sprint is to establish the ground works for the project. This includes setting up the development environment, studying about the Synergistic Leadership Theory, creating initial UI/UX designs, and designing the data model.
